                        <p> After years of living, working and loving in Oakland, our team noticed a common complaint among the diverse, yet ever growing LGBT community in Oakland.  Despite the fact that every day Oakland seemed to get better, safer and open the doors of another fun place, there was no seven day a week gathering place for the LGBT community in our thriving downtown.  Our team, armed with background in small business entrepreneurship, economic development and community service sought to change that.</p><br />

                        <p>The management team is an especially close one. Together we share a single vision: to provide a unique and entertaining experience through exceptional service to LGBT East Bay residents and their heterosexual friends.
